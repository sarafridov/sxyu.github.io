                Hi! I am currently a second-year CS and Applied math major at UC Berkeley. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I am involved in Virtual Reality research, primarily applying computer vision to support human-computer interaction in virtual environments. In my free time I actively participate in <a href="http://codeforces.com/profile/Doriath">competitive programming</a> and am a member of <a href="https://ugtcs.berkeley.edu/about.html">UGTCS</a> (the Undergrad CS Theory club), Virtual Reality @ Berkeley, as well as the Canadian Student Association.
                </p>
                <p>
                Previously, I attended <a href="http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/uhill/Pages/default.aspx">University Hill Secondary School</a> in Vancouver, Canada and studied for a year at the University of British Columbia (UBC) through the Concurrent Studies program.
                </p>

                I have been responsible for running the hog contest for the past several semesters. I got first place in the same contest when I took the course in Spring 2017 and the hog contest has always been my favorite part of the course. In my time however the program for running the contest was very slow, and took as long as one week to finish evaluating once in Fall 2017. To improve upon this I created a new parallelized system written mostly in C++ for running the contest. Now the evaluation takes so little time that I have even put up a live leaderboard, <a href="http://35.211.92.166/">hosted</a> on Google Cloud Platform!

                        <em>Doriath</em>, which means &quot;Land of the Fence&quot; in Sindarin, is the name of a (former) elvish nation in J.R.R. Tolkien's Silmarillion. It is also an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath_(video_game)">adventure game</a> for the Commodore 64, whose name is probably taken from Tolkien.
			I first started using <em>Doriath</em> as a player name for Age of Empires II, since I thought it was an appropriate name for a nation, but eventually started to use it elsewhere as well, even where it makes less sense.
