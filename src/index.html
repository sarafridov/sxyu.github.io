        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        Hi! I am a third-year CS and applied math double major at UC Berkeley. 
        While I am still trying to pinpoint my interests, since last fall I have mostly focused on CS theory-related coursework and am currently studying information theory and coding.
        </p>
        <p>
        Nevertheless, I also enjoy apply abstract knowledge through programming, and have worked on a number of ML and mostly low-level software <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
        In particular, I believe in the future of Extended Reality technology, and have been involved at the FHL Vive Center since my first year at Berkeley. My current work focuses on applying advances from computer vision, human-computer interaction, and optimization to overcome limitations in present VR/AR technologies.
        For the past two semesters, I have been working on human avatar reconstruction as part of a Ford University Research Project.
        
        </p>
        <p>
        Reflecting these interests, I am a member of UGTCS (the Undergrad CS Theory club) and XR @ Berkeley. I am also a fairly inactive member of the Canadian Student Association.
        </p>
        <p>
        Prior to Berkeley, I attended University Hill Secondary School in Vancouver, Canada and studied for a year at the University of British Columbia (UBC) through the Concurrent Studies program.
