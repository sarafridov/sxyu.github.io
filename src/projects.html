                <strong>Avatar</strong> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQ0g_R77x80c6WbFKTXefvsNO9F1ITxW/view?usp=sharing">demo video</a>): Last fall, I led a small team developing the avatar tracking system for OpenARK (Open Source Augmented Reality Kit) at the FHL Vive center. You may find the latest development version in the <a href="https://github.com/sxyu/avatar">avatar</a> repository, which may eventually be integrated into OpenARK itself. The system is based on nonlinear programming using the SMPL model and a Random Forest for segmentation. I have also built a number of utilities for working with the SMPL model in C++.

                I worked on the hand detection module for
                <a href="https://github.com/augcog/OpenARK">OpenARK</a>: Open Augmented Reality Kit which is a simple system using an SVM and convex hull to extract hand keypoints.
